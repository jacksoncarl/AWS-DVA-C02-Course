# 1. DVA-C02 Notes 

I have compiled these personal notes while taking Adrian Cantrill's (DVA-C02) course. You can find the course resources on GitHub at https://github.com/acantril/aws-dev-associate. If you're interested, the course is available for purchase on https://learn.cantrill.io/.

This approach was also inspired by https://github.com/alozano-77/AWS-SAA-C02-Course/blob/master/README.md
